# dots-C
Simply dot game withouth graphic interface made in C language. A project I did for the university.

Game language is on spanish and some feautures are yet unfinished like EXIT and RESTART options.
Game uses Windows header #include <windows.h>
so it will work properly on windows, not sure about Linux.

Created in Dev-CPP and coded in like 2-3 hours.
